# Algorithms and Data structures

My repository for showing different and new ways to look at code and to allow me to deveop my skills in Algorithms and data structures. Code will be mostly within Java but will have some various languages throughout 


Some algorithms presented here include
* [The Knuth-Morris-Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm) string matching algorithm
* [Kadanes algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem) for max subarrays
* [Quick Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
* [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
* [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
* [radix sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort)
